# Image Processing Utility
This is the multimedia image processing project in which multiple image processing techniques have been implemented such as Color2Gray, Flip_H, Flip_V, scaling, negative of the image etc. 

**Question:**

Write a GUI based Image Processing Application in Java (a sample code is provided).
The application performs following.
- 1. Creates a GUI which reads and image .
- 2. A list of operations is given in a combo box. Based on the selected operations,
the image should be updated.
- 3. An image library ( a class is provided with blank functions) needs to be
developed which contains code for the operations listed in ComboBox.

**What is in Sample Code**
The sample code contains following.
- 1. (GUI) ImageApp.java (contains the code to draw and handle GUI )
- 2. (GUI) Image.java (contains the code for displaying images). This class is used by
ImageApp.java to display/handle images
- 3. (Image Operations): ImageLibrary.java which contains balnk functions. You need
to fill in the code so that some desired operation is performed.
- 4. Following is the list of operations you are required to implement.
  - 1. Color2Gray
  - 2. Flip_H (Flip Horizontal)
  - 3. Flip_V (Flip vertical)
  - 4. Apply 3x3 Weighted Averaging
  - 5. Apply 3x3 Gaussian convolution kernel
  - 6. Scaling (resizing) up or down
  - 7. Negative of the image
  - 8. Rotate the image by a certain degree (Left or Right)
  - 9. Any other operation you are interested in.

Note: The sample code provides just an initial guideline. You are free to use your
creativity to improve the code as much as you like. Your creativity will get you better
grades.
